This program was written in Java with JavaFX. The program requires JRE 13 to run - if 13 or above is not installed at launch, the program will open the JRE 13 download page.
The program is runnable with PizzaPalace.exe, and the source code is provided. Dependencies were handled with Gradle.
This codebase is also available on Turner's personal GitHub at https://github.com/crazyroo1/SWEPizzaProject
